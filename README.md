# Bit and Byte stuffing
Bit stuffing and Byte stuffing is a framing technique. This is carried out by data-link layer in the OSI model.
The bits are converted into frames and delimiter is added to identify the size of frame. 
If the delimiter occures in the message then either bit stuffing or byte stuffing is used.
## Bit stuffing
  A pattern of bits of arbitary length is stuffed in the message to differentiate from the delimiter.
## Byte stuffing
  A byte is tuffed in the message to differentiate from the delimiter.
